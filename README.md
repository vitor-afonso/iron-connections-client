# IronConnections

IronConnections is my third Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp project. With this project i am supposed to build a SPA using ReactJS NodeJS, Express & MoongoDB.

## About the project :crystal_ball:

IronConnections is a social media app :busts_in_silhouette: that once logged in you can follow other users, see your connections posts, create posts, like and comment posts.
My goal was to implement the basic features of a social media. I took advantage of the best that React has to offer, making use of states, props, context, components etc...
